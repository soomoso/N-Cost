earnings, deductions, and real take-home pay, our tool gives candidates the confidence to compare offers,
understand hidden costs, and choose opportunities that truly match their financial needs.</p></div><div class="nc-help__feature"><span class="nc-help__feature-tag">REDUCE GHOSTING AND RENEGOTIATIONS</span><h3 class="nc-help__feature-title">For HR and recruitersc</h3><p class="nc-help__feature-resume">Candidates frequently ghost offers or renegotiate at the last minute once they realize their actual take-home
pay is much lower than expected. By sharing a clear, accurate breakdown generated by our calculator
(gross → all deductions → net + 13th + vacation bonus), you reduce surprises, speed up the hiring process, and
build trust — because the first time they see the real number isn’t on their first payslip.</p></div></div></div></section><script src="./dist/assets/js/script.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
